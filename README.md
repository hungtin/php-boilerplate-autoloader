# Small boilerplate for ImageWorkshop supported autoloader.
## Installation

I have git pulled the ImageWorkshop lib in ```lib``` directory.
Create the ```composer.json``` file to include the lib path with the namespace that you want to bound to.

Git pull ImageWorkshop to your lib

```
cd lib
git pull https://github.com/Sybio/ImageWorkshop
```

Run this command to generate the autoloader for you.
```
composer install
``` 

Enjoy with the ```index.php``` test run.
